git clone https://github.com/ivory-penguin/Jari-OliBer-game
and then go into the created directory in vscode

then, whenever you are done updating a file, run
git add .
git commit -m "some commit message"
git push -u origin main
git pull

if you get an error about fast forwarding, run
git pull --rebase
to pull the files you do not have on your local copy (shouldn't overwrite your files)
